# Noten

This project was intended to be part of a multiplayer arcade game running over the internet, but has since been put on hold. In the mean time, it is yet another Pong clone. Noten is written in Javascript and HTML5. 

To play, open `client.html` in any HTML5-supporting browser. Space launches the ball and the up/down arrow keys move the paddle. A live demo of Noten can be played at http://as3r.com/static/noten/noten.html
